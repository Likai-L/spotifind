SpotiFind is a geosocial music application for Spotify users to find, interact and make friends with people who have similar music tastes.

With the Spotify Web API, SpotiFind shares your liked history and currently playing track on behalf of you, so that you can find and be found by people who liked or are listening to the same songs as you.

Discuss, chat and enjoy music together with like-minded people on SpotiFind!

## Getting Started

## Final Product

## Feature Demos

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
